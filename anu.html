                I so desperately want to hold you
                the way Van Gogh held to his art
                the way beethoven held to his music
                and Jane Austen to her writing
                these things kept these people alive
                the way I breathe to see another day with you
                the way I want your beautiful sweet
                cinnamon-honey kisses
                to never leave the touch of my skin</p>
                
                <p style="color:rgb(241, 96, 28)"> I can’t afford to lose you, i cannot lose you
                not when the world around me
                is burning to the ground in flames
                not when sense stops making sense
                not when you’re the only ray of sunshine left
                
                i don’t want to let you go
                when this absurd contest if
                “who has it worse” seems to never end
                I want you to stay, please stay
                
                i want you to love me when
                the universe screams in my face
                that love isn’t real and doesn’t exist
                I want you to open my history books
                and read for yourself the long list of
                people walking all over me only to walk out
                you’d see names of precious ex-lovers
                and silhouettes of long forgetten friends</p>

                we’d be undefeatable with the kind of
                love that’s meant to be unbelievable
                i promise to never let you go
                you’d never forget what happiness feels like
                I’ll have your handprints on my soul
                and I promise, if you stayed, so would I.</strong>
